## 📖 Overview

This lab demonstrates building a lightweight Python automation tool that:

- Uses external packages installed via pip (`requests`, `rich`)  
- Executes modular Python scripts from the command line  
- Tracks dependencies in `requirements.txt`  
- Performs file I/O and provides a CLI interface for tasks  

The lab includes:

1. `generate_log.py` – Generates a log file and fetches a sample post from a public API.  
2. `task_manager.py` + `cli.py` – CLI task manager to add, list, and complete tasks.
